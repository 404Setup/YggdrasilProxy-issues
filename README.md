# YggdrasilProxy-issues

This repo is only used to collect issues.

The source code is available on the mod's full download page.

The proxy detection module has been separated into [t-proxy](https://github.com/404Setup/t-proxy).

You still need to be aware that it is available under the ARR license (the Mod version), but you can still customize your own version by using t-proxy (as long as you don't use YggdrasilProxy's code)
